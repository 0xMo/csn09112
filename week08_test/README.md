#Test 1 (Some principles)

    1. Key Enthropy [ Try]. How many bits can represent X phases? Just take the Log(X), and divide by Log (2).
    2. John the Ripper, Hashcat and Ophcrack: Here
    3. Using OpenSSL to salt passwords: Here
    The table you will use in the test is: Here and you can use a calculator.

#Study Questions

Try to review your knowledge by answering these questions:

    Can you convert characters from one format to another, such as in binary, hex, ASCII and Base-64 (remember: hex uses four bits at a time, and Base-64 uses six bits at a time)?
    Do you know the basic theory of converting a bit stream into Base-64 (remember 6 bits at a time and convert from table)?
    Do you understand how to use some key ciphers, including shifted alphabet, scrambled alphabet, Vigenere, Pigpen and rail codes?
    Can you do a simple Diffie-Hellman calculation and end up with the same shared key?
    Do you understand how the number of keys relate to the security of the ciphers?
    Can you work out key enthropy, so that if you have 2,048 phases, you can calculate that this is equivalent to 11 bits [log(2048)/log(2)]?
    Would you know how long it would take to crack a code next year, if it takes 10 years now, and computing power doubles each year?
    Do you understand how public and private key encryption is used, along with the usage of digital certificates?
    Do you understand the conversion of passwords into hashed passwords, and use tools such as John The Ripper, Hashcat, Ophcrack and OpenSSL?
